intro_1: In this case, we have a cooling system with the purpose of lowering the temperature of a particular device by using a refrigerant fluid.
intro_2: The table below shows the result of using an increasing volume of this fluid **(mL)** and the corresponding impact on the temperature **(°C)**:
title_graph_1: Fluid vs. Temperature
Fluid: Fluid (mL)
Temperature: Temperature (°C)
comment_1_graph_1: We can see a linear dependency between volume and temperature, so we could use **linear regression** in order to build a prediction system which is able to approach the fluid's behavior.
comment_2_graph_1: In order to reach this goal, *SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent)* will be used. This method will adjust regression line's **slope (gradient)** and **intercept** values, reducing a **cost function** value as much as posible after a certain number of iterations **(epochs)**.
comment_3_graph_1: The cost function represents the difference between the regression line and the actual data.
comment_4_graph_1: *SGD* technique is a key component of *Neural Networks*' functionality.
comment_initial_values: **Slope** and **Intercept** will be assigned some *random initial values*:
Slope: Slope (m)
Intercept: Intercept (b)
Cost: Cost
title_graph_2: Actual values vs Initial Regression Line
comment_SGD: Applying SGD method, as the number of iterations (epochs) increase, the value of the cost function decreases and the regression line is being adjusted better to the actual values:

Epochs: Epochs
